# For this project, I requested my personal data from Spotify for the previous year.
# Then I created a table to insert the Spotify data into. 
# I had to figure out how to convert JSON files to CSV files and add a unique id number to the data in Excel.
# Once that was figured out, I imported all the data into the table.  
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

# Creating the Table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Personalspotifydata (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
endTime timestamp NOT NULL, 
artistName varchar NOT NULL,
trackName varchar NOT NULL,
msPlayed integer NOT NULL
) 

# Since Bad Bunny was my number 1 artist last year, I wanted to figure out how many times he appeared in the data. 

SELECT COUNT(artistName) AS times_played
FROM BIT_DB.Personalspotifydata
WHERE artistName LIKE '%Bad Bunny%';

# times_played = 1293

# My next question was which track did I play the most?

SELECT  trackName AS most_played, COUNT(trackName) AS value_occurrence
FROM BIT_DB.Personalspotifydata
GROUP BY trackName
ORDER BY value_occurrence DESC 
LIMIT 1;

# most_played = Titi Me Pregunto | value_occurrence = 133

# Up next, I wanted to find out how much time I spent listening to music last year. 

SELECT SUM((msPlayed/1000)/60) AS minutes_played  
FROM BIT_DB.Personalspotifydata;

# minutes_played = 34617 or roughly 24.04 days of listening time
