# In this project I am querying a database with multiple tables to answer questions about the customers, employees, invoices, etc. 

#1 Show customers who are not in the US 

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA'; 

#2 Show only the customers from Brazil 

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Country 
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil'; 

#3 Find the invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The table should show full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country 

SELECT FirstName, LastName, InvoiceID, InvoiceDate, BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers
LEFT INNER JOIN chinook.invoices
ON chinook.customers.CustomerId = chinook.invoices.CustomerId
WHERE BillingCountry = 'Brazil'; 

#4 Show the employees who are sales agents 

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5 Find a unique list of billing countries from the invoice table 

SELECT distinct(BillingCountry) Unique_Billing_Country
FROM chinook.invoices; 

#6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, invoiceID
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers ON chinook.customers.SupportRepID = chinook.emp.EmployeeID
JOIN chinook.invoices ON chinook.invoices.CustomerId = chinook.customers.customerID; 

#7 Show the invoice total, customer name, country, and sales agent name for all invoices and customers. 

SELECT 
cust.FirstName Customer_First_Name, cust.LastName Customer_Last_Name, cust.Country, 
emp.FirstName Employee_First_Name, emp.LastName Employee_Last_Name, 
inv.total invoice_total
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON cust.SupportRepID = emp.EmployeeID
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON inv.CustomerID = cust.CustomerID;

#8 How many invoices were there in 2009? 

SELECT COUNT(InvoiceDate) Total_Invoices_In_2009
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'; 

#9 What are the total sales for 2009? 

SELECT SUM(total) 
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%';

#10 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID. 

SELECT tracks.Name, items.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks tracks 
JOIN chinook.invoice_items items ON items.TrackID = tracks.TrackId;
