# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle 
# Then I created a table to insert the spotify data into 
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL 

# Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

# After the table was created, I inserted the Spotify Data . csv into the table 

# Next I came up with questions and explored the data using the following SQL: 

#1 Which artist had the most songs in the Top 50 songs of 2021? 

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name) Appearances
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY Appearances DESC
LIMIT 2; /* There were two artists with 4 songs each in the top 50 */

#2 Which track has the fastest tempo for 2021? 

SELECT track_name Track_Name, MAX(tempo) Fastest_Tempo 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#3 What was the average tempo for the Top Songs of 2021? 

SELECT AVG(Tempo) Avg_Tempo_of_Top_50_Songs
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata; 

#4 Who were the top 10 Artists based on popularity and what was the name of the track? 

SELECT artist_name, popularity, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;
