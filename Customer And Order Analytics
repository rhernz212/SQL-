#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1 How many orderes were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(Product)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone'
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND length(orderID) = 6;

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were places in February
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON BIT_DB.customers.order_ID = BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID
WHERE BIT_DB.customers.order_id <> 'Order ID'
AND length(BIT_DB.customers.order_id) = 6; 

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January and what was the price? 
SELECT Product, MIN(price) Price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'; 

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Rev can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products)
SELECT Product, ROUND(SUM((Quantity) * price),2) Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, (SUM(Quantity) * price) Revenue, SUM(Quantity) Quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'; 

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct(cust.acctnum)) Total_Customers, AVG(quantity * price) Average_Price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FebSales.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE Quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT distinct Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;
